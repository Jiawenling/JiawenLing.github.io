title: How it began
---

## August 2021 was the starting point

I began coding in earnest after being accepted in TFIP program, hosted by IBF and various financial institutions.
After 3 months of training with NUSISS (or 1.5 months actually if you leave out the breaks in between), I am now an apprentice at a hedge fund, learning OTJ.
During the training period, the topics we covered were:
* Java
* Spring Boot
* Angular
* MySQL

These frameworks also exposed us to HTML/CSS/Javascript/TypeScript, and we used Heroku and Gitpages for deployment

The breadth of topics were appropriate for a start, but I felt that the depth was somewhat limited. To top it off, the firm I was attached to uses C#. Yet another language to learn, before I can even go in-depth on one language..

## Finding and setting my foothold...

I'm not a fan of rock-climbing, but I do find that learning to code on your own is similar to this strenuous activity. Except that you got to make your own footholds.

Formal education and training gives you temporary footholds. Once that's over, you'll be looking at a bare rock wall. 

Setting a foothold is planning, and ascending the rock wall is learning. It will be an iterative process, so a conscious effort must be made to determine what to invest my time in, and what experiences I will seek. 


### The first foothold

This website is an attempt to gain discipline. Also, there's a notion of learning in public, and there's also the practice of writing journals to sort out your thoughts, so I figured why not do both?
If all else fails, this website will be used to document concepts that I struggle to understand.

For starters, I'll try to cover an adequate depth on C#, then move on to cover technologies that are commonly used by developers

Over the next quarter, the things I would like to cover:
1. Docker
2. C#
3. MongoDB 
4. Leetcode - in python
5. Personal project - My manga notification app :) 

I'll check in again on my quarterly goals in June. 

For now, leaving the first of my favourite quotes:
***what would you do if you were unafraid?***

Happy struggles! >:)
