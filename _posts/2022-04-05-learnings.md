### Data Structures

I am having troubles deciding the types of data structures to use to communicate between two methods whilst working on a monitoring feature....

Trying to avoid multiple layers of nested structure by using a class but even then struggling to think of the right way to represent the state of the object. 

Also concerned with memory/performance issue with no real way to monitor it. 

Overthinking...but just letting it out here.
